                <div class="about-text">
                <p>Hello there! My name is Mirthe, a creative furniture maker who is always curious and 
                excited to learn new things. I love creating and bringing ideas to life, both within and outside the woodworking field.
                The past few years I have been busy with several projects, at first as a student, later as a craftsman.</p>

                <p>Okay, a bit more background information.<br>

                In 2018 I graduated high school and decided to study "Creative Workmanship", specializing in woodwork and design.
                Here I learned how to work with several materials and tools, both traditional and modern. Think of tools such as a chisel
                or hand plane, but also CNC machining, laser cutting, 3D printing and digital modeling and technical drawing. </p>

                <p>In 2022 I did my graduation project, using AI in the designing process (<a href="prompt13_2022.html" style="color: #215e49;; text-decoration: underline;">prompt 13</a>). 
                When I started that project, the term 'AI' was still unkown to the general public, making the project seem very unique and one-of-a-kind.
                However, when the project came to an end, the use of AI started to get a lot of attention in the news, forcing people to form an 
                opinion on the use of it. Where my project started as a 'revolutionary concept' praised by both teachers and fellow students, it 
                ended in disaster. The use of AI is generally not appreciated within the creative community and the idea of AI stealing other artwork, 
                plagarism and ending human creativity took over. In order to learn what truly goes down under the hood of AI and to be able to form a well-informed opinion on my own work,
                I decided to apply for a study program called 'Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence' in University.</p>

                <p>Believe it or not; data science and woodworking have more in common than you would expect! Both require you to think outside
                the box and have good problem solving abilities. Coding is like making puzzles, but instead of it being a 3 dimensional brain-breaker
                like with woodwork, everything stays digital. Since one of my hobbies is making puzzles, I loved this! After the first study year I recieved the propeadeutic 
                degree with an average GPA of 3.9 (8.8/10). However, I decided to not continue with the course, as I missed the physical woodwork too much. 
                It did teach me how to code though, so it helped me make this entire website from scratch!</p>

                <h3>Current work</h3>
                <p>At this moment I keep myself busy with several projects like furniture making, carpentry and general woodworking for both companies and private clients.
                In 2024 I also started traveling all over Europe using <a href="https://www.workaway.info" style="color: #215e49;; text-decoration: underline;">Workaway</a>. 
                This is volunteering work at local families and communities, where you work in exchange for food and a place to sleep. This kind of work feels very rewarding, it 
                directly helps people that are (financially) unable to hire professionals. I see it as an amazing and valuable way to travel
                and perfect if you want to learn more about different places, cultures and yourself!
