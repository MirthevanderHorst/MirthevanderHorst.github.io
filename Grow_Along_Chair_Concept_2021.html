            <h2>Grow-Along Chair Concept</h2>
            <p>This chair was originally meant as a woodworking project. I wanted to design a chair that would fit within an already existing furniture line by 'Weltevree', a Dutch outdoor product company.</p>
            <p>Sketching was mainly done by making simple 3D models in Sketch-Up. Once happy, I drew it in Vectorworks (I only had the free Sketch-Up, so the student Vectorworks software was easier to use).</p>
            <p>To add attributes like the wooden people and child safety-cushion, I experimented with and used Blender. Then, to render it, Fusion360 was used. At that point, Fusion360 was the only software I knew how to make renders with, making it a logical choice.</p>
            <p>While working on this project, I learned a lot about design and 3D modeling software. The design was not really something I liked enough to recreate with real wood, but it sure was an interesting project!</p>
